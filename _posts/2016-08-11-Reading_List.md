title: Reading List
---

I decided to compile a list of texts that I have read and feel have helped advance my development skills. Regrettably, I have more books than I have time to read, so below I'll list those books I've read and provide a brief description. I'll do my best to update both the list and the descriptions as I go along.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470975728&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a>
This book is a must read for anyone starting to write code (and even a seasoned veteran may take away a thing or two ). The author, Richard Martin, introduces you to many concepts that will greatly improve your code's readability and does a fantastic job of keeping the reader engaged.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-2nd/dp/0136108040/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1470977271&sr=1-3&keywords=computer+systems">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (2nd Edition)</a>
I used this text for my computer organization course, and it provided a great introduction to the inner-workings of a computer system.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Sierra/dp/0596009208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470975622&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+into+java">Head First Java</a>
Head First Java is a great introduction to Java. It does a phenomenal job of explaining the Java syntax, objects, inheritance, and object oriented design in general. I usually recommend this book to my tutees as it uses easy-to-understand analogies and examples.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470975658&sr=8-1&keywords=html+and+css">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a>
Indepth introduction to HTML and CSS.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0124116442/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing, Second Edition: Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Made Easy</a>
This book offers a good introduction to the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking as well as many of the processes and tools involved in the trade.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Command-Line-Complete-Introduction/dp/1593273894/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470975773&sr=8-1&keywords=the+linux+command+line">The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction</a>
I had used linux for a long time before picking this book up; however, even for someone with some experience, this book had a lot to offer. It introduced me to various tools, tips and tricks that have greatly improved my understanding of Linux.
