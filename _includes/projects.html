            Mini Search Engine (Python)
          </a>
          </strong>
        </br>Created a simple search engine using a web crawler to
          retrieve approximately 5,000 documents from the
          <a href="http://muhlenberg.edu/">muhlenberg.edu</a> domain. The documents were
          then indexed using an inverted index, which was leveraged when calculating
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf">Tf-Idf</a> vector weights to
          generate a vector space model of all the documents and the user's query.
          Then, using cosine similarities, the highest ranked results were calculated and
          returned.

            HMM Part of Speech Tagger (Python)
          </a>
          </strong>
          </br>Used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">Viterbi algorithm</a>
          to create a part of speech tagger using bigram calculations,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">hidden Markov
          model</a>, and the NLTK Brown corpus to train and test the model.
          Achieved ~91% accuracy.

          </strong>
          </br>A website created for my Database class that allows the user  to
          interact with a database that keeps tracks of theater members, productions,
          donors, seats, etc. The website has additional features such as the ability
          to create accounts, purchase tickets, and view a list of ongoing productions.
